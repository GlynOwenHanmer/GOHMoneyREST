### Disclaimer:
This repository contains some not-so-best-practices as it is a personal project in which I try out new techniques and ways of working. As always, some of these techniques end up not being the best way of working; they are kept in the project, however, until I find a good time/requirement to refactor.

# mon

Mon is a simple finance-tracking set of packages and application.

### Future Improvements
- Remove package globals
- Implement Go modules
- Move to an event-sourced model
